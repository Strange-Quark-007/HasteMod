# HasteMod

A client-side mod that abuses the instamine feature to very quickly mine set types of blocks.

# Default controls

- U: Toggle mod on/of
- X: Activate/use block breaker (when instamine is possible)
- Y: Toggle Block Selection Mode
- I: Toggle Tool Switch

# My Personal Tweaks

- Updated to 1.20.4
- Added option to toggle tool switch (instead of being always ON) and a keybind ( default I) to toggle the same.

- Ignore all torches (also wall variants) from being insta-mined.

# How to use

When enabled, mine one instamineable block of choise to select it as the target block. When activating (the X key), the mod will try to instantly break all blocks in player (= 4 blocks) reach.
This can be really useful when e.g.: mining for stone, andesite, sand, ...
